# Deep Work - Cal Newport

CAVEATS: 
	* This is not a true summary. It contains only the information that was useful or interesting to me, personally. 
	* I've stripped all context from the source. The actual book effectively backs up suggestions with anecdotes, interviews and stories.  

KEY:
[D] - Definition explicitly given; sometimes modified for brevity
[T] - Tip, Tactic, Tangibles; explicit advice or instruction from author
[Q] - Quote; a direct quote from a third-party included within the narrative. Usually verbatim. 
// - Comments, sarc, snark, general insertions of my own views.

## Part 1; setting context and defining stuff

[D] Deep Work - Distraction free concentration that pushes cognitive capability to limits. Creates new value, improves skills and is hard to replicate. 

[D] Shallow Work - Non cognitively demanding work, logistical style tasks, often done while distracted. Low value, not new, is easily replicable. 

[D] Deep Work Hypothesis - Deep Work is increasingly rare while it simultaneously becomes increasingly valuable. Those who cultivate and make a core attribute will thrive.

### Great restructuring, worker group classifications 

[D] Great restructuring - The gap between machine and human abilities is shrinking, 3 groups will have advantage 

[D] High Skilled - Oracular abilities, typically working with complex machines or systems.
[D] Superstars - Peak of the talent market, usually has a choice on what opportunities they take on. 
[D] Owners - Capital owners investing in technology that enables the great restructuring.  

### Core abilities needed to thrive in this new economy

	1. Master Hard things fast
	2. Produce at an elite level, maintaining high quality with rapid delivery. 

[Q] "To learn requires intense concentration" 

[Q] "The difference between expert performers and normal adults reflects a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain" 

[Q] "Men of genius... Were great only by bringing all their power to bear on the point on which they have decided to show their full measure" 

### Deliberate Practice 

	1. Attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you're trying to improve.
	2. You receive feedback so you can correct your approach in order to keep your attention exactly where it is most productive. 

Learning is training the brain to envelop neurons in myelin. 

Productivity is the batching of hard but important work into long uninterrupted work

Attention residue - when sequentially switching tasks we do not perfectly shift over our focus, a residue of attention remains stuck on the previous task. 

High level executives don't often perform deep work, their value and skill set is being able to perform highly despite this .

As knowledge work becomes more complex the value of an individuals contribution becomes harder to measure. 

[D] The principle of least resistance - In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of behaviours on the bottom line we (humans) tend towards the easiest behaviour  at the given moment

The PLR (^) encourages cultures that opt to save us from short term discomfort of concentration and planning at the expense of long term satisfaction and the production of real value. 

[D] Busyness as proxy for productivity - Without clear indicators of productivity knowledge workers turn back towards 'do lots of stuff in a visible manner' 

[Q] "Skilful management of attention is the sine qua non [an indispensable and essential action, condition or ingredient]  of the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience" 

[Q] "When you lose focus your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what's right"


### Flow 

[Q] "The best moments usually occur when a persons body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile"

The more flow experiences in a week the higher the perceived satisfaction of ones work. 

The feeling of 'going deep' is of itself rewarding 

Craftsmanship provides a reopening of a sense of sacredness in a responsible manner... It offers a source of meaning sited outside the individual. 

[Q] "Beautiful code is short and concise... Another programmer would say "oh, that's well written code". It's much like... writing a poem"  

'Meaning' doesn't come from rarefied jobs, the specifics of a job don't really matter, meaning comes the skill and appreciation inherent in craftsmanship

## Part 2; Rules to help achieve depth

[Q] "Desire turned out to be the norm, not the exception" 

The key to developing deep work habits is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to working life... to minimize the willpower needed to transition into and maintain unbroken concentration.

### Deep work philosophies 
		
	These should fit your specific circumstances! 

#### Monastic philosophy 
	
Maximise deep efforts by eliminating or minimizing shallow obligations. E.G escaping to a cabin in the woods periodically, refusal of obligations and rejecting ability to be contacted. 

Practitioners tend to: work in professions that have well defined and highly valued goals, success comes from doing one thing very well. 

#### Bimodal Philosophy 

Divide time, some clearly defined stretches of deep work and leaving the rest open to everything else. This can be scalable at multiple levels (e.g. you split a work week into 2 sections, or you split a year by season etc.)

Minimum unit tends to be one day. 

#### Rhythmic Philosophy

Generate a rhythm (see 'chain method') that becomes a habit, removing the decision to begin deep work. 

Chain method - Make a mark everyday you do something, keep the chain going. 

Time based - Maintain a set time period where you only do deep work 

#### Journalistic Philosophy 

Fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule .

Not for a deep work novice; you need practice to be able to switch the mind from shallow to deep. 

[Q] "Waiting for inspiration to strike is a terrible, terrible plan... The single best advice... to anyone trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration" 

### Rituals 

They're useful. // Good note taking me

Questions a ritual should address

	* Where does it take place, how long does it last
	* How will you work once you start?
	  * It's encouraged to add structure and rules to help you stay focused
	* How will you support your work
	    * What will you use to help trigger the changeover, what environmental factors will you control

	! EXPERIMENT - Test things out and see what works, failure is only now  knowing what doesn't work  !

### The Grand Gesture 

Leverage a radical change in environment, possibly paired with an investment of money and effort to increase the perceived importance of the task. 

### The 4 Disciplines of execution 

[D] Focus on the wildly important - execution should focus on a small number of wildly important goals - a small number of ambitious outcomes that would deliver tangible and substantial benefits. 

[D] Act on the lead measures - measure your success. 
	
	* Lag Measures -the thing you're trying to improve. These come too late to change behaviours. 
	* Lead measures - measures the new behaviours that will drive success on lag measures - in a deep work context this can be 'time spent in deep work dedicated to your goal'.

[D] Keep a compelling scoreboard - A public place to record and track lead measures, this drives focus via competition and acts as a source of motivation // this is from an American business viewpoint, in case it wasn't obvious enough :eyeroll: 

	[T] Maintain a personal scorecard that tracks your hours spent in deep work. Circle the moment/hours key milestones are hit. 

[D] Create a cadence of accountability - A rhythm of regular and frequent meetings of teams that own a W.I.G. 

### Know when to stop for the day

[Q] "I am not busy. I am the laziest ambitious person I know" 

[T] At the end of your workday, shut down work considerations until the next morning. 

Providing your conscious brain with time to rest enables your unconscious mind to take a shift sorting through your most complex professional challenges.

Attention restoration theory; spending time in nature improves ability to concentrate (weather doesn't matter!) 

A novice can sustain intense concentration around an hour (1) a day while experts can get up to four (4) but rarely more. 

[T] Shutdown Rituals - every incomplete task, goal or project has been reviewed and you either:
	
	1. Have a plan you trust for completion
	2. Have captured the work in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right. 

[T] Have a final phrase, uttered aloud, to indicate shutting down from the workday // goofy but does seem to help

The Zeigarnik effect - the ability for incomplete tasks to dominate our attention. Counter it by making a plan for how you will alert compete the incomplete task. 

### Embrace boredom

Efforts to deepen focus will struggle if you don't simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction // never felt so called out by a book before

[Q] "People who multitask all the time can't filter out irrelevancy. They can't manage a working memory. They're chronically distracted" 

Deep work training takes two (2) steps: 

	1. Improve the ability to concentrate intensely
	2. Overcome the desire for distraction

[T] Schedule a break from focus to give in to distraction, instead of scheduling moments of focus.

[T] Restrict access to the internet, note down the next time you can use the internet 

Don't immediately abandon an offline block of time because you are stuck. If you must shift focus, alter the schedule. Do not immediately transition into web usage, minimum of a five (5) minute wait. 

[T] Productive Meditation - a period where you are occupied physically but not mentally and focus attention on a single, well defined problem. 

Avoid distractions while thinking in this meditation - say you'll think about it later) 
Avoid loops, be on guard for them, when you observe you are in a loop remark to yourself that you are in a loop and redirect your attention back onto the problem. 

### Structuring Deep thinking

[T] Define variables, hold these in memory
[T] Define the next step question 	// author is a comp. scientist and it shows 

[D] Attentional control - the ability to maintain focus on essential information. 

### Quit Social Media

Suggests that there are different models for analysing the value of social media in ones life. 

[D] The any benefit approach to network tool selection - justification exists if you can identify any possible benefit to use it or there is any potential for opportunity loss. 

[D] Craftsmen Tool Selection - Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if positive impacts substantially outweighs its negatives.

[D] The law of the vital few - Often 80% of a given effect is due to just 20% of possible causes 

^ Describes a power law; if you had a list of 15 potentially beneficial activities it's probably the top 2-3 that will matter.

[Q] "Mental faculties are capably of continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or leg. All they want is change, not rest except in sleep". 

### Drain the shallows

Treat shallow work with suspicion, its damage is often vastly underestimated and its importance is vastly overestimated.

If you're between the ages of 25-34 you likely watch more T.V than you realise. // Please stop calling me out Mr Newport

[T] Schedule every minute of your day - create estimates of time blocks, based on tasks or clusters of similar tasks. Review your estimates, be shocked that you estimated wrong and revise, repeat until you estimate correctly. 

Overflow conditional blocks - if you're really unsure about how long something may take, schedule split blocks afterwards; these can either be used to continue the task or work on a defined alternative task. 

Scheduling isn't about restraint, it's about thoughtfulness. 

### Quantifying Depth

[T] A test - How long (in months) would it take to train a smart recent university graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete the task? 

### Shallow work budgets

[T] Another prompt - What percentage of my time should be spent on shallow work? What would my manager say? What do I want that number to be?

Typically people report 30-50% of time is spent on shallow activities // gross 

Your default answer can become no - this is you raising the bar for access to your time and attention, you're not being obstinate. 

### Become hard to reach 

[T] Make people who email you do more work. 

Implement a sender filter - set expectations on who should be emailing you, what you want to receive and highlight more suitable contacts for other types of queries. 

### Do more work in emails

Resist the urge to quickly resolve emails to get them done, consider if putting more effort / being more thorough now will stop or reduce future contact. 

You should be aiming to 'close the loop' with each of your emails.

### DON'T RESPOND 

// capitalized because I can confirm it's great

It's the senders responsibility to convince the receiver that a reply is worthwhile. 

[T] Do not reply if any of the following applies:
	
	* The email is ambitious or otherwise difficult to generate a response. 
	* It's not a question  or proposal that interests you
	* Nothing really good, or really bad, would happen if you didn't respond. 

[Q] "Develop the habit of letting small bad things happen. If you don't, you'll never find time for the life-changing bad things".
