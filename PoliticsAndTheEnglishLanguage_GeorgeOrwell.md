# Politics and the English language 

Staleness of imagery; lack of precision. 

Dying metaphors - worn out metaphors that have lost all evocative power, used only to save the trouble of inventing your own. 
    E.g: 
		ride roughshod over
		stand shoulder to shoulder
		play into the hands of

Operators or verbal false limbs - a verb becoming a phrase; a noun or adjective tacked onto a general purpose verb.
	E.g:
		render inoperative
		give rise to
		make itself felt
		take effect

Pretentious Diction - dressing up simple statements, giving an air of impartiality to biased sentences.
	E.g:
		phenomenon
	exhibit
	exploit
	utilize


Meaningless words // obvz.

Over-aggrandized text is easy to write. Saving mental effort at the cost of leaving your meaning vague. 

A scrupulous writer asks four things of himself:

1. What am I trying to say?
2. What words will express it?
3. What image or idiom will make it clearer?
4. Is this image fresh enough to have an effect?

...and will probably ask two more:

1. Could I put it more shortly?
2. Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?

[Q] The great enemy of clear language is insincerity.

Let the meaning choose the word, not the reverse. 

Rules to rely on when instinct fails:

i) never use a metaphor or similie, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in a speech.
ii) Never use long words when a short one will do. 
iii) If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
iv) Never use passive where you can use active.
v) Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or jargon word if you can think of an everyday equivalent.
vi) Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous. 

[Q] If you simplify your English you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy... when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself.
