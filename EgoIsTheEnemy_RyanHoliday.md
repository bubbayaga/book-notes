## Ego is the enemy

[Q] The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool. 

[D] Ego - an unhealthy belief in our own importance

[Q] - Self confidence becomes arrogance, assertiveness becomes obstinacy and self-assurance becomes reckless abandon. 

Ego inhibits true success by preventing a direct and honest connection to the world around us. 

### Book Goals

Help the reader be: 
	* Humble in aspirations
	* Gracious in our success
	* Resilient in our failures 

## Aspire 

[Q] No adornment so becomes you as modesty, justice and self control, for these are the virtues by which the character of the young is held in restraint

[Q] - Talent is only the starting point

Arrogance and self-absorption inhibit growth, as does fantasy and 'vision'

Many valuable endeavours we undertake are painfully difficult... but talking is always easy 

[Q] Mere gossip anticipates real talk, and to express what is still in thought weakens actions be forestalling it. 

Silence is the respite of the confident and the strong 

[Q] Never give reasons for what you think or do until you must, maybe after a while a better reason will pop into your head. 

Goal visualizing is good but after a point our minds confuse it with actual progress

### Talk less

[Q] To be or to do? Which way will you go?

Having authority is not the same as being an authority.

What you choose to do for money works on you with your time 

### Be a student

Places ego and ambition in someone else's hands

[D] Shamrock Martial art Training - plus, minus and equal; have someone better they can learn from, someone lesser they can teach and someone equal to challenge themselves against 

Get real and continuous feedback about what they know and what they don't from every angle 

Put yourself beneath someones trust; accept others know more and that you can benefit from their knowledge; seek out others for help

A student is like a sponge; absorbs from surroundings, filtering it, latching on to what he can hold

Be self-critical and self-motivated, always be trying to improve understandings so you can move onto next topic or challenge. 

[Q] It's impossible to learn what one thinks one already knows.

### Don't be passionate 

It takes years to become the person you are known as; it's a process of accumulation.

Passion typically masks a weakness

Humans require, to ascend, purpose and realism;
[D] Purpose - passion with boundaries
[D] Realism - detachment and perspective 

Passion is *about* ("I'm so passionate about XYZ")
Person is *to and for* ("I must do X, get here to accomplish IJK")
Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself, as opposed to pleasuring yourself. 

[Q] Great passions are maladies without hope. 

The critical work that you want to do will require your deliberation and consideration, not naivete. 

[Q] Surtout, pas trop de zele ("Above all, not too much zeal") 

### The canvas strategy 

Find canvases for other people to paint on, clear the path for people above you to eventually create a path for yourself. 

When starting out a few fundamental realities:
1) You're not as good as you think you are
2) Your attitude needs adjusting
3) Most of what you know is out of date or wrong. 

[Q] A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts, so he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions. 

Just because you are quiet doesn't mean you are without pride. Privately thinking you're better than others is still pride. It's dangerous

[Q] That on which you so pride yourself will be your ruin, you with think yourself someone. 

[Q] The best plan is only good intentions unless it degenerates into work. 

Having an idea isn't enough, you must work until you are able to recreate your experience effectively. 

[Q] You can't build a reputation on what you're going to do. 

To get where we want to go isn't about brilliance but continual effort. 

## Success

### Always stay a student 

[Q] As our island of knowledge grows,so does the shore of our ignorance. 

### Don't tell yourself a story

Narrative is when you look back at an improbable path and say "I knew it all along", not that "I hoped" or "I worked"

Writing our own narrative leads to arrogance and turns us into characters while still having to live your life. 

Once you win, everyone is gunning for you; this is when you least effort ego; the stakes are much higher and the margin for error lower. 

Reducing success to a narrative retroactively creates clarity than never was and never will.

[Q] The way to do really big things seems to be to start with deceptively small things.

### What's important to you?

[Q] To know what you like is the beginning of wisdom and of old age. 

Competitiveness is important but it is critical to know who you're competing with and why. 

Too often we look at other people and make their approval the standard we feel compelled to meet and as a result squander our potential and purpose. 

[D] Euthymia - the sense of our own path and how to stay on it without being distracted by the others that intersect it. 

[T] Why do you do what you do? 

### Entitlement, control and paranoia 

A smart man or woman must regularly remind themselves of the limit of their power and reach .

[Q] He who indulges empty fears earns himself real fears. 

### Managing yourself

[Q] It is not enough to have great qualities; we should also have management of them.

Moving up the ladder; the system and work habits that got us where we are won't keep us there. 

### Meditate on the immensity 

[D] Sympatheia - Connectedness with the cosmos.

### Maintain your sobriety

[Q] Fight to be the person you philosophy tried to make you. 

Sobriety is the counterweight to success; egoless sobriety has an element of restraint - the elimination of the unnecessary and the destructive 

## Failure

[Q] Almost always your road to victory goes through a place called failure. 

[D] Narcissistic injury - when we take personally totally indifferent and objective events. 

Adhere to a set of internal metrics that allow evaluation and gauging of progress while outsiders were too distracted by supposed signs of failure or weakness. 

### Alive time or dead time

[D] Dead time - people are passive and waiting
[D] Alive time - learning, acting and utilizing every second. 

### The effort is enough

[Q] What matters to an active man is to do the right thing; whether the right thing comes to pass should not bother him.

[D] Katabasis - 'A going down'

[D] Duris dura fraguntur - Hard things are broken by hard things. 

A big failure typically comprises 3 elements:
	1) Almost always comes at the hands of some outside force or person
	2) They often involved things we already knew about ourselves but were too scared to admit. 
	3) From the ruin comes opportunity for great progress and improvement.

### Draw the line

[Q] It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character

### Maintain your own scorecard

Make a distinction between your inner scorecard and the external one - your potential, the best you're capable of is the metric to measure yourself against. 

### Always love 

Are we going to be miserable just because other people are? 

### For everything that comes next, ego is the enemy

[Q] I don't like work, no man does, but I like what is in the work - the chance to find yourself.
