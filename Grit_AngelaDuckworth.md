## Part 1 -  What Grit is and why it matters 

No matter the domain, highly successful people have a kind of ferocious determination that plays out in 2 ways: 

1) Unusually resilient and hardworking
2) they knew, in a very deep way, what it was they wanted

[D] Grit - Passion and perseverance 

'Talent' does not relate to the grittiness of a person. 

Our potential is one thing, what we do with it quite another 

### Distracted by talent 

Talent is regarded as the greatest predictor of success but sustained effort often ends up being the differentiator. 

Society has a bias / tenderness towards 'naturals' 

Strivers vs natural study - entrepreneur strivers only hit similar external ratings with 4 more years of leadership experience and $40k moire startup capital. 

Shining a spotlight on talent we risk leaving everything else in the shadows. 

### Effort counts twice

Dazzling human achievements are the aggregate of countless individual elements which are each ordinary. 

[Q] Our vanity... promotes the cult of the genius... for if we think of genius as something magical we are not obliged to compare ourselves and find ourselves lacking. 

Talent is how quickly your skills improve when you invest effort -> talent x effort = skill

Achievement is what happens when you take your skills and use them -> skill x effort = achievement

### How gritty are you:

Passion can also be 'consistency overtime' not just intensity. 

Passion as a compass - takes time to build, tinker and get right and then guides you on your long road to where you want to be. 

Grit is about holding the same top-level goal for a very long time; where you find it so interesting and important it organises a great deal of your waking activity.

Any successful person has to decide what to do in part by deciding what not to do. 

You should give up a low level goal if another is more feasible. 

### Grit grows 

Talent is not solely genetic, skill development rate is also a function of experience. 

Social multiplier effect; more people practicing a skill enriches the learning environment and so higher skill levels become more routine and push the skill ceiling higher. 

Grit grows as we figure out our life philosophy, get used to rejection and disappointment and learn to differentiate low-level (abandonable) goals and higher level that demand more tenacity. 

Maturity principle; over time we learn lessons and adapt in response to change in circumstance. Eventually these become habitual and then we barely remember our old ways / immature self.

[T] Four psychological assets paragon gritters have:

1) [D] Interest - intrinsically enjoying what you do (Does not mean enjoy every element equally).
2) [D] Practice - discipline of daily efforts, trying to do better than yesterday. 
	- Devote to focused, full-hearted, challenge-exceeding-skill practice that leads to a mastery.
	- Zero in on weaknesses and do so repeatedly. 
3) [D] Purpose - Conviction that your work matters. 
4) [D] Hope - Rising to the occasion through perseverance and belief in oneself. 

## Part 2 - Growing grit from the inside out 

### Interest 

Job satisfaction increases when working on something that fits personal interests and those people tend to be overall happier.

People perform better at work if it interests them. 

Finding a passion can take years of exploring interests. 

Young people often suffer from unrealistic expectations that things should happen fast and be perfect in every way. 

Passion is a little of *discovery*, followed by a lot of *development* and then a lifetime of *deepening*. 

Interests are not discovered through introspection but interactions with the outside world. Without experimentation you can't discover which interests will stick and which wont.

The initial discovery of an interest often goes unnoticed by the discoverer.

Boredom is self-conscious but attention and attraction may have little reflective appreciation.

What follows discovery is a lengthier and increasingly proactive period of interest development - the initial holding of attention must be followed by subsequence encounters that retrigger attention. 

Interests thrive with a crew of encouraging supporters. 

[Q] Just because you love something doesn't mean you'll be great" 

Good mentors make the initial learning very pleasant and rewarding. 

A degree of autonomy is also needed, you can't press a passion on someone else. 

Athletes who sample a variety of sports before committing generally fare better. Athletes who skip this often enjoy an early advantage but are more likely to be injured or burned out. 

Rush a beginner and you'll bludgeon their budding interest.

Novelty for beginners is something not encountered before, for experts novelty is nuance. 

How to solve the NYT Crossword puzzle:

	Begin with the answers you're sure of and build from there - however ill defined your interests there are things you know you hate doing and some more promising, that's a start

	Don't be afraid to guess - interest discovery has an element of trial and error, no need for 'right' or best, just a direction that feels good. 

	Don't be afraid to erase an answer that isn't working out. 

### Practice

[D] Kaizen - continuous improvement; resisting the plateau of arrested development. 

A persistent desire to be do better, the opposite of complacency but its a positive state of mind, not a negative one. It's not looking back with dissatisfaction, it's looking forward and wanting to grow. 

Skill gradually improves over years. As you get better the rate of improvement slows - 10,000 hours to become an expert. 

[D] Deliberate practice:
	- Set a stretch goal, narrowing on specific aspect of performance. 
	- Attention and effort to meet a stretch goal. 
	- Hungrily and ASAP seek feedback 
	- Repeat until mastered, with reflection and refinement. 

Deliberate practice feels significantly *more effortful* and significantly less enjoyable than other forms of practice. 

Deliberate practice is experienced and supremely effortful. Even world-class performers at their peaks can only handle a max of 1 hour before needing a break and in total can only do about 3 - 5 hours of deliberate practice per day. 

--- Flow vs Deliberate Practice ---

DP = carefully planned; Flow = spontaneous 
DP = working where challenge exceeds skill; Flow = challenge and skill
DP = exceptionally effortful; Flow = effortless. 

[Q] Gritty people do more deliberate practice and experience more flow. 

Gritter spells rated DP more enjoyable and more effortful. 

DP lends itself to the thrill of getting better. Flow is the ecstasy of performing at your best.
--- 

Make DP a habit; make it automatic. 
Change the way you experience it. 

In the moment of self-awareness without judgement, relieve yourself of the judgement that gets in the way of enjoying challenge. 

### Purpose 

Common sequence of purpose discovery:

1. Self-orientated interest. 
2. Self-disciplined practice. 
3. Integrate with an other-centred purpose. 

[D] Purpose - what we do matters to people other than ourselves. 

Gritty people seek pleasure as much as anyone else but are dramatically more motivated than others to seek meaningful, other-centred life. 

Grittier people tend to describe their profession as a calling vs 'a job' or 'a career'.

'Callings' aren't 'found', they're a way of looking at ones work.

Leaders and employees who keep personal and pro-social interests in mind do better in the long run. 

[T] Recommendations for cultivating purpose: 
	Reflect on how your current work can make a positive contribution to society. 
	Think about how, in small meaningful ways, you can change your current work to enhance its connection to your core values.
	Find inspiration in a purposeful role model. 

### Hope // worth re-reading 

Suffering doesn't lead to hopelessness; its suffering you think you can't control that does. 

Optimists habitually search for temporary and specific causes of suffering. 

Pessimists assume permanent and pervasive causes are to blame. 

[T] When you keep searching for ways to change your situation you stand a chance of finding them. When you stop searching, assuming they can't be found, you guarantee they won't. 

'Failure' should be interpreted as a prompt to try harder not a confirmation that one lacks the ability to succeed. 

[Q] Children have never been very good at listening to their elders but they have never failed to imitate them. 

A gritty perspective involves recognising that people get better at things - they grow. 

[T] Growth mindset -> optimistic self talk -> perseverance over adversity. 

## Part 3 - Growing Grit

### Parenting for grit

There is no either or trade off between supportive parenting and demanding parenting. 

[Q] I'm giving you these comments because I have very high expectations and I know you can reach them. 

### The playing fields of grit. 

[D] Learned industriousness - the association between working hard and reward can be learned. 

### A culture of grit

If you're around a lot of people who are gritty, you're going to act grittier. 

It can be years or more before grit dividends pay off.

Thinking of yourself as someone capable of overcoming tremendous adversity often leads to behaviour that confirms that self-conception. 

[Q] The origin of great leadership begins with the respect of the commander for his subordinates. 

## Part 4 - Conclusion

You can grow your grit: 

* Develop a habit of daily challenge-exceeding-skill practice.

* Connect your work to a purpose beyond yourself. 

* Learn to hope when hope seems lost. 

[Q] Writing *is* failure. Over and over again.
